# Mohu / Gap Tracker

This file tracks only current blocking items for `docs/plan.md` ↔ implementation closure.

Rules:
- Exactly two sections: `Gap` and `Ambiguity`.
- Keep only open items here.
- Closed history is tracked in `docs/verify_log.md` and git history.

---

## 1. Gap (not implemented)

- None (as of 2026-02-06).

## 2. Ambiguity (plan vs implementation unclear)
